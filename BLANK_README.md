    Healthcare Analysis with SQL is a project where I used SQL to examine a healthcare dataset. I dug into the data to find patterns and insights related to heart disease, smoking history, age, gender, and more. It's a practical analysis that might be helpful for anyone interested in healthcare data or looking to understand this dataset better.
